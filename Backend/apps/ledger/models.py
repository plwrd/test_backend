"""
apps/ledger/models.py

Immutable append-only credit ledger.

RULES -- DO NOT VIOLATE:
1. LedgerEntry records are NEVER updated
2. LedgerEntry records are NEVER deleted
3. Every credit grant, consumption, adjustment, and reversal must
   produce a LedgerEntry
4. The acting_user and acting_context must always be recorded
5. previous_balance and resulting_balance must always be recorded

Credit balance for any user is always derived by querying this ledger.
There is no mutable balance field anywhere in the system. If you find
yourself writing to a balance column outside this table, stop -- that
is a design violation.

This is a financial integrity requirement.
Any implementation that allows update or delete on LedgerEntry fails
automatically.
